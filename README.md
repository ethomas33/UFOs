# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
This website utilizes javascript, d3, and bootstrap to make a website that contains some contextual text as well as an interactive table to display UFO data. 

## Results: 
This website has some interactivity. You will notice the filters on the left side of your screen. 

![FilterSection](https://github.com/ethomas33/UFOs/blob/e0a4e928f46406f1a1e35cebd1b2cc86b449082e/static/images/Website_filter.png)

Here you can input information such as city, state, etc. and the table will dynamically filter for those inputs. As seen here filtering for the state of California. 

![FilterSection_CA](https://github.com/ethomas33/UFOs/blob/e0a4e928f46406f1a1e35cebd1b2cc86b449082e/static/images/ca_filter.png)

You can also add additional filters such as city or shape in addition to state.  

## Summary: 
While this websites functionality is great for basic exploration of the data it lacks some of the more robust basic functionalities I would expect from a filtered table. Someone who is completely new to this dataset might not have a guess what potential shapes exist for UFOs or what states there may or may not have been a sighting. I think changing these filter boxes from text to drop downs would be very beneficial to the user. 
Additional recommendations I have are to allow the user to select more than one option - such as two states as well as give them the ability to export their desired selection to an excel file that they can further investigate.
